Using the command line interface the user will run node and input a function that they want to carry out:  total, deposit, withdraw, and lotto.  The total will read the bank.txt file and return the total to the user.  With deposit and withdraw the user needs to specify a number after each, i.g. "deposit 3", "withdraw 45".  If the user deposits money, the program will tell the user how much money they deposited and alert the user what the new total in the account is.  Same with a withdrawal only opposite.  Lotto is the fun part!  A user will type lotto into the CLI and the program will deduct $0.25 from the account.  If the user wins they'll get $2.00 added to the account.  To win, a randomly generated number from 1-10 must match the program's previously selected magic number.  This number is regenerated every time the user inputs lotto.
